# Frontend Mentor - Rock, Paper, Scissors solution

This is a solution to the [Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- :heavy_check_mark: View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- :heavy_check_mark: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- :heavy_check_mark: Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser \*(optional)\_
- :x: **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_

## Used tools

- Nuxt 3 (Vue 3)
- Pinia
- Tailwind

## My goals

- :heavy_check_mark: I want to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors application
- :heavy_check_mark: I want to practise Vue 3 and Nuxt 3 state management
- :x: I want to create a "mobile first" design, and only using Tailwind without any custom CSS
  - Sadly, I encountered a Tailwind error that required some custom CSS workaround. :(

## Highlights

- I created a single Disk component that can be called with different `type` prop values to show a `rock`, `paper` or `scissors` component, and I added a `size` prop, so it can create a `md` or `lg` component.
